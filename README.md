# 📅 LeetCode Daily Streak Tracker

Welcome to my ongoing journey of solving **LeetCode problems daily** — even during my semester exams!  
This isn't a strict challenge like my previous [60-day grind]([https://github.com/your-60-day-repo-link](https://github.com/Douglas0207/30-days-Challenge)), but a **commitment to consistency**. Even 1 problem a day keeps the DSA fears away. 💪

## 🎯 Goal

Maintain a **daily problem-solving streak** throughout June 2025 with at least **1 problem a day** — no breaks, no excuses.  
Focus: **Linked Lists, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Trees** and more as I go.

## 🧠 Mindset

> _"Success doesn’t come from what you do occasionally. It comes from what you do consistently."_  
Even during **exams**, I'm solving problems because I'm chasing consistency, not perfection.
