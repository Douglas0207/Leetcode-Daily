# 📅 LeetCode Daily Streak Tracker

Welcome to my ongoing journey of solving **LeetCode problems daily** — even during my semester exams!  
This isn't a strict challenge like my previous [60-day grind](https://github.com/your-60-day-repo-link), but a **commitment to consistency**. Even 1 problem a day keeps the DSA fears away. 💪

## 🎯 Goal

Maintain a **daily problem-solving streak** throughout June 2025 with at least **1 problem a day** — no breaks, no excuses.  
Focus: **Linked Lists, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Trees** and more as I go.
